## Genetic Algorithm

Genetic algorithms are a kind of search algo-rithm that seek to find solutions from a prob-lem space by making use of the Darwinian principles of variation, inheritance, and selection. In the context of biological evo-lution, individuals within a population who harbor traits that are more fit for their environment are more likely to pass on those traits to the next generation, such that there is an increase in that trait in the population over time. Similarly, in genetic algorithms, individuals with good genes according to a fitness function can pass on those genes to the next generation, which can lead to convergence to a solution over successive generations.
